# Banker's Algorithm GUI

This is a Python GUI application that implements the Banker's algorithm for deadlock prevention. The program allows the user to enter the following inputs:

- The total number of resources available
- The amount of each resource currently available
- The amount of each resource currently allocated to each process
- The maximum amount of each resource needed by each process

The program then allows the user to enter a request for additional resources for a specific process. The Banker's algorithm is used to determine whether the request can be granted safely without causing a deadlock.

## Installation

To run the program, you'll need to have Python 3 and the Tkinter library installed on your system. If you don't have Tkinter installed, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install tkinter
```

Once you have Python and Tkinter installed, simply run the `bankers_algorithm_gui.py` file to launch the program.

## Usage

When the program starts, you'll see a GUI with several input fields for the resources and processes. Here's a description of each field:

- Total resources: Enter the total number of resources available.
- Available resources: Enter the current amount of each resource available.
- Current allocation: Enter the amount of each resource currently allocated to each process.
- Maximum need: Enter the maximum amount of each resource needed by each process.
- Request: Enter a request for additional resources for a specific process.

To add a new resource or process, click the "Add Resource" or "Add Process" button, respectively. To add a request for additional resources, click the "Add Request" button.

Once you've entered all the necessary inputs, click the "Check Request" button to see if the request can be granted safely. If the request can be granted safely, a message will be displayed indicating that the request has been granted. If the request cannot be granted safely, a message will be displayed indicating that the request has been denied.
